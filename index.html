          <h6 style="color: #731018;"><i>A Legacy Etched in Law</i></h6>
          <p>Thiru. N. Natarajan was one of the most formidable minds in Indian criminal law, whose legal career spanned over six remarkable decades. Beginning in 1955 under the tutelage of stalwarts like P.S. Kailasam and S. Mohan Kumaramangalam, he quickly distinguished himself through his analytical brilliance, compelling courtroom presence, and unwavering dedication to the cause of justice.</p>
          <p>Appointed as Public Prosecutor in 1975 and designated as a Senior Advocate in 1978, he became a household name in the legal fraternity. From prosecuting in the historic Bofors case and the Bombay Bomb Blasts trial to defending convicts in the Rajiv Gandhi assassination matter before the Hon’ble Supreme Court, Thiru. N. Natarajan’s career reflected a rare balance of prosecutorial rigor and deep constitutional compassion.</p>
          <p>Admired for his humility, clarity of thought and impeccable ethics, he mentored generations of lawyers and judges, many of whom today occupy leading positions in the judiciary and the Bar. His legacy endures—not just in law reports and landmark judgements, but in the values he lived by and instilled in others: fairness, mentorship and intellectual integrity.</p>

        <p>Established by the juniors and disciples of Late Thiru. N. Natarajan, the N. Natarajan Charitable Trust stands as a living tribute to a life devoted to law, learning and service. With a mission to continue his vision of accessible and ethical legal education, the Trust focuses on empowering the next generation of students and lawyers—particularly those from underrepresented backgrounds.
        </p>
       <p> Now in its decennial year, the Trust has been at the forefront of initiatives that blend scholarship with service: conducting National and State-level Moot Court Competitions, organizing Law Lecture Series featuring leading legal minds and sponsoring the education of deserving students who exemplify promise and perseverance.
    </p><p>      Its core objectives are rooted in creating pathways for academic excellence, expanding access to legal education and nurturing a generation of legal professionals driven by principle, empathy, and public spirit.

        <p>The N. Natarajan Charitable Trust Moot Court Competition, hosted in collaboration with the Madras Bar Association, is one of Tamil Nadu’s most prestigious State-level moot events. It is open to law students across Tamil Nadu and Puducherry and is envisioned as more than a contest—it is a courtroom experience.</p>
        <p>What sets this competition apart is the depth of its authenticity. Adjudicated by sitting judges of the Hon’ble Supreme Court of India and Hon’ble High Court of Madras and leading Senior Advocates of the Madras Bar, every round mirrors the decorum, intensity and expectations of real-world legal proceedings.</p>
        <p>
            Celebrating the Trusts decennium, the competition pays homage to Thiru. N. Natarajan’s legacy—championing the art of advocacy, the discipline of research and the ethics of legal practice. It is a platform where young minds not only test their skills but also encounter the ideals that defined Thiru. Natarajan’s life and practice.

          <li>
            State of Tagaland is located in the south east peninsula of Indica with a population of nearly 8 crore people. About 23% of Tagaland’s population are senior citizens and about 11% thereof are pensioners in the State of Tagaland. Chera is its capital, a metropolitan city.
          </li>
          <li>
            In the Fiscal Policy Paper published by the Finance Department of Tagaland on 01.05.2024, it was mentioned that:
            <i>
              “This pension scheme covers all employees of the State. At present there are 3,50,000 employees in Government who are covered under the Old Pension Scheme. In addition, there are 7,32,000 Pensioners and Family Pensioners receiving pension and family pension under the Scheme. Demand No.10 provides for a total expenditure of Rs.30,000 Crore towards pension and other pensionary benefits and that it would come into effect from 01.05.2024 and shall operate retrospectively.”
            </i>
          </li>
          <li>
            The State of Tagaland had also mentioned its intention to create a technology-forward governance infrastructure, including digitization of pension records under the ‘Pension Pay’ Initiative. This initiative was a joint effort between the Department of Pensions, the Department of Electronics and Digital Systems, and private AI developers empanelled with the Tagaland Tech Vision Framework, 2023.
          </li>
          <li>
            The Demand also recorded that:
              <i>"A web-enabled software to  process the pension payment and to have a centralized  database of the pensioners is implemented in all the Districts  and Pension Pay Office, Chera. Under this scheme, the  monthly pension and other retirement benefits to the  pensioners are now credited directly to the bank account of  pensioners through Electronic Clearing Service. A total number  of 5,75,000 Pensioners have mustered Digital Life Certificate  (Online) and 45,000 pensioners mustered by utilizing the door  step services of Indica Post Payment Bank"</i>
          </li>
          <li>
            To augment the reach of digital onboarding, pensioners were  encouraged to visit the ‘Pension Pay’ web portal. This portal  collected front-camera data and requested access to photo  galleries for AI comparison of old photographs with live  selfies. While the privacy policy of the portal stated that data  would only be used for verification, it allowed third-party  access under ‘technical consultancy’. The link to the portal  ‘Pension Pay’ was available on the official website of the  Tagaland Pension Department. Digital Life Certificate Online  could be availed through e-verification involving Aadhaar  two factor authentication and voice recognition. The portal  stored in an online server, the Aadhaar information, voice  data and the IP address of the user in its back-end in  encrypted form.
          </li>
          <li>
            Mr.Rajesh, a retired Additional Secretary of Tagaland State  Government, who superannuated on 02.07.2024, filed a  complaint on 01.10.2024 with DCP Tagaland Cyber Crime  Wing, Chera. The complaint stated the following: 
            <ol type="a">
              <li>On 23.09.2024, I received a WhatsApp message from  +91-9876543210 claiming to be from ‘Tagaland Pension  Verification Cell’. The message contained an official looking logo and stated: “Dear Pensioner, due to AI  system upgrade, verification of your pension account is  mandatory. Click here to update your details within 48  hours to avoid pension suspension”. The link directed me  to <a href="www.tagalandpensionverify.in" target="_blank"> www.tagalandpensionverify.in</a> which appeared  identical to the official Pension Pay portal.</li>
              <li>I entered my pension ID, Aadhaar number, received an  OTP, which I had entered. In the next screen, I was asked  to enter the details of my bank account linked for the  purpose of remittance of pension. When I entered the  bank account details, I received an OTP for confirmation  on my registered mobile. Upon entering the OTP, the next  screen showed “verification successful”.</li>
              <li>Thereafter, to my shock and surprise, on 24.09.2024, I  received an SMS from my banker that an amount of  ₹2,47,000 was debited from my pension account in 4 multiple transactions. Upon my query, I was informed by  my banker that the debit was made upon my approval  through entering OTP on 23.09.2024. When I contacted  the official Pension Pay Office, they informed me that no  such verification was required and that the website is not  the official website of the Pension Pay Office.” 
                </li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>
            In the same week, several cyber complaints began to emerge  in the city, where multiple pensioners reported failure to  receive credits despite successful digital muster. Banks  raised alerts about bulk transfers from pension accounts  into a series of UPI-linked virtual wallets. Suspecting a large  scale fraud and cyber theft, the CCW initiated preliminary  inquiry on suspected unauthorized access, data theft and  identity fraud in relation to ‘Pension Pay’.  
          </li>
          <li>
            Investigation revealed the following modus operandi: 
            <ol type="a">
              <li>A criminal syndicate led by Aaron (36), a software  engineer from Bangalore, created an AI-powered system  that scraped publicly available pension data from  government websites and social media profiles of retired  employees. 
              </li>
              <li>The syndicate used deep-fake voice technology to make  verification calls to pensioners, mimicking the voices of known government officials whose speeches were  publicly available online. 
              </li>
              <li> The website www.tagalandpensionverify.in was hosted  on servers located in Eastern European countries and  used SSL certificates to appear legitimate. 
              </li>
              <li>
                The syndicate employed a network of money mules  across different states to withdraw cash immediately  after the fraudulent transactions.  
              </li>
            <li>Pensioners who had used the portal for online life  certification between 01.07.2024 and 25.09.2024 were  the primary victims. </li>  
            <li>During the investigation, the CCW recorded detailed  statements from 47 affected pensioners. Mrs. Devi (72),  a retired school principal, testified that on 15.09.2024,  she received a voice call from someone claiming to be  Mr. Suresh Kumar from Pension Pay Office. She stated:  “The voice was exactly like our former District Collector  who used to address us during retirement functions. I  recognized his tone, his way of speaking, even his slight  stutter when saying ‘verification’. That's why I trusted the  call completely.” When shown audio recordings of the  actual District Collector's speeches, she confirmed the striking similarity but noted subtle robotic undertones  she had missed during the fraudulent call. 
            </li>
            <li>
              Mr. Giri (68), a retired engineer, provided testimony  about receiving a video call on WhatsApp from what  appeared to be a Pension Department official. His  statement recorded: “The person on video looked exactly  like Mrs.Priya, Joint Director of Pensions, whom I had met  personally during my retirement processing. Her  appearance and the government office background were  identical. When I later contacted Mrs.Priya, she confirmed  she had never made such a call.” Technical analysis later  revealed the video used Mrs.Priya’s photographs from  official government websites combined with deepfake  technology. 
            </li>
            <li>
              During the investigation, it was discovered that the  syndicate had (i) Hacked into the email accounts of 15  retired employees using credential stuffing attacks,  accessing their correspondence with pension offices, (ii)  Created fake mobile applications mimicking the official  Pension Pay app, which were distributed through third party app stores and infected devices with malware and  (iii) Used AI chatbots on social media platforms to identify potential victims by engaging them in  conversations about pension-related grievances. 
            </li>
            <li>
              The CCW’s technical analysis (via digital forensic toolkit)  found traces of synthetic face generation tools being  hosted on servers with IP addresses traced to a co working space in Chera for Trio Technologies Pvt. Ltd.  (TTPL). 
            </li>
            <li>
              Acting on digital intelligence and surveillance logs, the  CCW raided TTPL’s co-working space on 18.10.2024 and  seized 4 workstations, 7 hard drives, and a server. The  Seizure Mahazar was prepared and two witnesses from  the same co-working space were present. 
            </li>
            <li>
              The seized digital devices were cloned at the spot using  certified hardware duplicators, and hash values of each  disk were recorded. The cloned copies were sent to the  State Digital Evidence Forensic Laboratory, Chera,  under chain of custody protocol.
            </li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>
            On 18.10.2024, Aaron, a graduate of Indica Institute of  Technology with a dual degree in AI and cybersecurity, was  arrested. He had previously interned at TTPL in 2024 and  had developed a test environment for facial recognition spoof testing. While TTPL denied current association, records  indicated Aaron retained back-end access credentials.  
          </li>
          <li>
            At the time of arrest of Aaron at his residence in Chera, the  CCW seized 3 laptops, 25 mobile phones, and hard drives  containing data of over 50,000 pensioners. At the time of  preparation of Seizure Mahazar no witnesses were present  and Aaron refused to share the details of his family members  when asked by Inspector, CCW at the time of arrest. Five  money mules were apprehended from different locations.  
          </li>
          <li>
            During interrogation Aaron consistently maintained that he  was conducting ‘ethical penetration testing’ of the Pension  Pay system. He claimed his activities were intended to expose  vulnerabilities in the government's cybersecurity  infrastructure. Aaron's statement to police recorded: “I am  an ethical hacker. My deepfake algorithms and penetration  tools were developed to demonstrate how easily the Pension  Pay system could be compromised by malicious actors. I never  intended to cause financial harm.” 
          </li>
          <li>
            Forensic analysis revealed that the seized devices contained  (a) Sophisticated AI algorithms designed to create  personalized phishing messages based on victims’  psychological profiles, (b) Database of government  employees' personal information, including family details, 9 obtained through various illegal means,(c) Communication  logs showing coordination with international cybercriminal  networks and (d) Cryptocurrency wallets containing the  equivalent of ₹15 crores in various digital currencies. 
          </li>
          <li>
            The CCW gave a public statement that during custodial  interrogation Aaron confessed (though this was later  disputed by the defense) that he created synthetic deepfakes  by training the model on open-access images of pensioners  found through their social media account pages. These were  run through a style-transfer filter to age-match them and  that he had used the insider knowledge about the Pension  Pay system’s vulnerabilities. 
          </li>
          <li>
            The Inspector of Police, CCW filed Charge Sheet dated  01.11.2024 before the Principal Sessions Court, Chera,  under Sections 111, 113, 318, 319(2), 336, 340, and 61 of  the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, 2023, Sections 66C, 66D and  72A of the Information Technology Act, 2000 read with  Sections 39 and 42 of the Aadhaar (Targeted Delivery of  Financial and Other Subsidies, Benefits and Services) Act,  2016. The five mules were charged under Section 317 read  with 61 of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, 2023. 
          </li>
          <li>
            The trial commenced in January 2025 and featured heavy  reliance on electronic evidence, including chat logs recovered 10 from the devices seized from Aaron and automated results  derived by decision making systems of the CCW, witness  testimony of forensic analysts who explained the hash match  of seized devices and Expert evidence from professors on the  working of facial spoofing.
          </li>
          <li>
            Seventeen pensioners testified about receiving personalized  voice messages on their registered mobile numbers. The  messages used the voices of deceased former officials,  including the late Chief Secretary, whose voice was  synthesized using his archived speech recordings from  government events. The CCW's victim impact assessment  revealed that 89% of the affected pensioners cited ‘voice  recognition’ and ‘familiar official appearance’ as primary  reasons for trusting the fraudulent communications.  
          </li>
          <li>
            During cross-examination of victims by the defense, several  pensioners admitted they noticed minor inconsistencies but  dismissed them as technical glitches. Mr. Gopal (71)  testified: “The lip movement seemed slightly off when the  official was speaking, and there was a brief delay in  responses, but I attributed it to poor internet connection. The  voice and face were so convincing that these small issues  didn't raise any red flags.” This testimony became crucial evidence for establishing how sophisticated deepfake  technology can deceive even cautious individuals.
          </li>
          <li>
            The prosecution presented expert testimony from Dr. Sarah,  a forensic audio analyst, who examined the voice recordings  recovered from victims' devices. Her analysis revealed: “The  synthetic voices contained micro-patterns consistent with  neural voice cloning technology. While imperceptible to human  ears, spectral analysis showed artificial harmonics and timing  irregularities typical of AI-generated speech. The deepfake  videos exhibited pixel-level inconsistencies in facial mapping  and lighting that are hallmarks of generative adversarial  networks”. 
          </li>
          <li>
            The defence challenged the chain of custody on the grounds  that the forensic clones were not sealed in tamper-proof  containers, one device’s hash value differed by one character  (suggesting possible alteration) and that Aaron’s so-called  ‘confession’ was extracted without his lawyer present and  under duress. 
          </li>
          <li>
            The defence also argued that the electronic evidence was  inadmissible, certificate under Section 63 of Bharatiya  Sakshya Adhiniyam, 2023 (BSA), cannot be admitted unless  cross-examined and validated by the original algorithm  developer. The Trial Court, admitted the electronic evidence 12 produced by the prosecution and overruled the objection by  observing that the electronic records were ‘maintained in  regular course of activity by authorized systems shall be  presumed genuine unless proved otherwise’. 
          </li>
          <li>
            Aaron's defense presented evidence that he had previously  submitted vulnerability reports to various government  departments through responsible disclosure channels. The  defense produced an undated letter, where Aaron had  allegedly attempted to contact the Tagaland Cyber Security  Cell to report potential vulnerabilities in the Pension Pay  portal. However, the prosecution contested the authenticity  of the letter, arguing it was created post-facto to construct a  defense narrative. Aaron claimed he received no response to  his vulnerability disclosure attempt, leading him to conduct  “live testing” to gather concrete evidence of the system's  weaknesses. 
          </li>
          <li>
            Expert witness Dr.Rajesh, a cybersecurity professor from  Indica Institute of Technology and Aaron's former thesis  supervisor, testified for the defense. He stated: “Aaron's  academic work focused on AI-based social engineering  defense mechanisms. The tools found in his possession are  standard components of ethical hacking toolkits. Deepfake  generation capabilities are essential for testing an organization's susceptibility to synthetic media attacks. The  mere possession of these tools does not establish criminal  intent.” 
          </li>
          <li>
            Aaron's defense counsel argued that the prosecution failed  to establish the crucial element of mens rea and that Aaron's  actions fell within the recognized practice of “authorized  testing without explicit permission”.  
          </li>
          <li>
            The prosecution countered Aaron's ethical hacker defense by  highlighting several factors: (a) No formal authorization from  any government department for penetration testing, (b) The  scale and sophistication of the operation involving multiple  money mules across states, (c) The creation of an elaborate  fake website designed to deceive rather than demonstrate  vulnerabilities, (d) The actual financial theft from victims,  and (e) The use of cryptocurrency wallets to launder  proceeds, which went beyond mere vulnerability  demonstration. 
          </li>
          <li>
            On 28.03.2025, the Sessions Court convicted Aaron,  sentencing him to 14 years of rigorous imprisonment and  imposed a fine of ₹50 lakhs. The judgment held that Aaron  used AI to subvert public benefit and noted that while AI may  be neutral, its deployment without ethical guardrails was an offence. The five mules were sentenced to 2 years simple  imprisonment and fine of ₹5 lakhs each. 
          </li>
          <li>
            Aaron filed an appeal before the High Court of Tagaland in  April 2025, contesting (a) Violation of Article 21 (due process  and privacy), (b) that BNSS and BSA enabled a ‘presumption  of guilt’ by relying on machines without transparent  accountability, (c) that the use of deepfake detection reports  cannot be a substitute for human testimony, and (d) that  there was no legislative framework governing AI evidence or  standards for biometric falsification.
          </li>
          <li>
            On the day when the matter was posted for Judgment before the High Court, Aaron's defense team filed a petition under  Section 245 of BNSS, 2023 requesting the Court to recognize  the “Ethical Hacker Defense” as a valid legal justification,  arguing that the current legal framework inadequately  distinguishes between malicious cybercriminals and  legitimate security researchers. They contended that Aaron's  prosecution would have a chilling effect on cybersecurity  research and vulnerability disclosure in the country. 
          </li>
          <li>
            The High Court confirmed the conviction, however, the  reasoning and basis of conviction by the two Learned Judges  of the Division Bench were on different/ independent  grounds. One Learned Judge, while confirming the order of 15 conviction and the sentence, noted the lack of a legal  framework on synthetic media and expressed serious  concerns about admissibility standards of such AI tools and  called for legislative reforms to establish ‘algorithmic due  process’.  
          </li>
          <li>
            Aggrieved by the order of the High Court, Aaron has  approached the Hon’ble Supreme Court of Indica challenging  the judgment of the High Court confirming the conviction,  the constitutionality of Sections 63 of BSA, the absence of an  AI Evidence Admissibility Protocol and the denial of his right  to confront digital evidence in violation of fair trial principles  under Article 21. The matter is placed before Five Judges of  the Hon’ble Supreme Court for final hearing on all issues.
